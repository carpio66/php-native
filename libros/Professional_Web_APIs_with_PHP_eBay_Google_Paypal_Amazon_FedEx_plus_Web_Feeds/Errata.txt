Errata Notice:
Hi, First, thanks for buying and reading the book, here is a list
of the problems I've discovered so far. I'm not sure exactly what 
process this file needs to go through to get from me to you, so I
will keep an up to date version at:
http://preinheimer.com/prowebapis/errata.txt

If you find any problems/bugs/mistakes not listed here please let
me know at: paul@preinheimer.com 

I'm well aware that there are copies of the book floating around
the net in .pdf or windows help format, if you came to this file
after reading one of those, and found my book helpful please 
consider purchasing a copy, I worked hard on the book so you 
wouldn't have to work quite so hard working on APIs.

Dashes are missing in the chart at the top, it should read:
The contents define a character class, [0-9] will match any digit from zero to nine, [a-zA-Z0-9] would match any single lower case letter, upper case letter, or digit. [a-zA-Z0-9] would match any number of them.

*SECURITY ISSUE*
The demonstrated REST API framework is vulnerable to XSS attacks
since it displays un-escaped data when a call is made with an
unknown paramater. Corrected code (simply applying htmlentities())
appears in the apropriate code file.
