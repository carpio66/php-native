[+] Add possibility to setup common CURL options for all CURL multi sessions.

2007-08-11 - version 0.01

[+] Primary version.
    Thanks to Pavel Kudrin (from http://weblancer.net/users/pk2002/) for
    initial discussion.
[+] Set query for CURL multi sessions. The main idea you can use only
    limited number of parallel requests. If you add next request, and
    the query is fully filled, the script waits while one or some previous
    CURL multi sessions will be completed.
[+] Set maximal size limit for downloaded content. Please note: it is
    possible to download rather more bytes than the limit because download
    operation uses internal buffer.
[+] Set common CURL options for all requests.
